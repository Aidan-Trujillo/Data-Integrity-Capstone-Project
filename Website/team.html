          <h1>Scott Larocca</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">My name is Scott LaRocca, and I am a PhD student in Ecological and
             Environmental Informatics at Northern Arizona University. My research focuses on bringing together
              technology and field based science to understand the response of ecosystems to climate change. 
              I have worked in the development of several environment and conservation focused web applications 
              and am excited to leverage this experience as a mentor for the capstone team.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">My name is Aidan Trujillo and I am a senior majoring in computer science. I 
              am the team lead for our group. I work full-time as an IT help desk agent and have been in the 
              IT field for about 3 years. My programming background stems from school mainly, but I also 
              take on some personal programming projects. I am excited to get to work with this team and 
              help promote conservation efforts around the world!

                My name is Fady Zaky and I am currently a Computer Science senior student. I have had experiences with
                many programming languages, some of which include C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Verilog. I have also
                worked as a teaching assistant for a variety of CS courses at NAU, and am currently a tutor for many CS
                and math courses. I am looking forward to applying all the knowledge I accumulated into this project
                and hopefully have our final product bring an impact to conservation efforts!
