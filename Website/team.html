            <p style="font-size: 20px;">My name is Aidan Trujillo and I am a senior majoring in computer science. I 
              am the team lead for our group. I work full-time as an IT help desk agent and have been in the 
              IT field for about 3 years. My programming background stems from school mainly, but I also 
              take on some personal programming projects. I am excited to get to work with this team and 
              help promote conservation efforts around the world!

                My name is Fady Zaky and I am currently a Computer Science senior student. I have had experiences with
                many programming languages, some of which include C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Verilog. I have also
                worked as a teaching assistant for a variety of CS courses at NAU, and am currently a tutor for many CS
                and math courses. I am looking forward to applying all the knowledge I accumulated into this project
                and hopefully have our final product bring an impact to conservation efforts!
