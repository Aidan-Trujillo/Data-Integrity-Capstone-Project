            Welcome to our team project where we are set out to help advance a concept known as citizen 
            science. Citizen science is a method of science that allows anyone to contribute to the 
            advancement of science by using their observations. With these observations, scientists can 
            collect a lot more data than is possible through simulations or testing in a remote setting.
            Applications have been created to support this advancement, and that is where we come in. As 
            citizens submit photos of their observations, we need to ensure the integrity of the photos 
            so that accurate conclusions can be made.
